### Hi there - Please see below for recent updates!(＾▽＾)

03/11/24 Current Project: Deep Learning-Based Eye Tracking Analysis for Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis  <br />
Assisting fellow colleague: Christian O. :) 

**Goal:**
+ Develop a deep learning model for feature extraction from raw eye tracking data.
+ Train the deep learning model on a dataset of eye tracking recordings from individuals with ASD and typically developing individuals.

We are working on leveraging the power of deep learning to enhance the analysis of eye tracking data for more accurate and efficient diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
