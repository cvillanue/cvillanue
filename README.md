# Hi there!

![MRI Data](https://github.com/cvillanue/Neuroimaging_inR/blob/main/Brain_Colors.png)

As you can see in the above figure, I clearly have too much free time. So, I spend it processing DICOM images in R, adding all the colors I can find, and pretending it’s art.✨✨
But in all seriousness, I’m genuinely fascinated by how the brain encodes and processes sensory input. I just mess around with neural data to make it pretty and try to understand what it means. 

### Paper's i'm currently reading at the moment:

- Brain Networks Underlying Episodic Memory Retrieval (Link: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594562/)
- The representational dynamics of task and object processing in humans (link: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5811210/)
- Recent Progress in Wearable Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) Devices Based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) for Medical Applications: A Review(https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/hds.0096)
  
### Updates: Training for my first 10K race in Dec (2025)  🏃👟

i'm listening to 🎧: [Listen to "Au Delà Du Réel (Instrumental)" by Syringa on Bandcamp](https://syringa-metal-instrumental.bandcamp.com/album/au-del-du-r-el-instrumental)
