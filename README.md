### Hi there - Please see below for recent updates!

04/02/24 Exciting Update! Christian and I are wrapping up the building phase of our FNN and LSTM deep learning models. We'll dive into the analysis phase and share our findings soon (pdf most likely available next week). Stay tuned for more updates on our progress in understanding ASD through machine learning and eye tracking data (:
