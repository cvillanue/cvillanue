### Hi there!

Paper's i'm currently reading at the moment:

- Do Humans and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Use Visual Information Similarly for the Categorization of Natural Scenes? (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8365760/)
- A case report of changes in asymmetric colour use in paintings produced over 3 years post-stroke by a patient with spatial neglect (link:https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00226-5)
- Musical tempo affects EEG spectral dynamics during subsequent time estimation (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301051123000340)
  

i'm listening to ðŸŽ§: [Listen to "Au DelÃ  Du RÃ©el (Instrumental)" by Syringa on Bandcamp](https://syringa-metal-instrumental.bandcamp.com/album/au-del-du-r-el-instrumental)
